# Nerd Shirts Texture Mod - Developers Guide

## Legal

Before you get started, please note the following:

**This mod is a dependency.**  Do **not** include any of the files from this mod in your own.  All you will need to do is create a sub-folder of the *\<tcgshop-home\>/BepInEx/plugins/nerd_shirts* and make this mod a dependency when you release on Nexus.  (I also plan to add mesh support and an API if there is enough interest).

TL;DR for the rest of this mumbo jumbo.  Just be sure to keep my code as a dependency and don't cut/paste it into your stuff.  You are legally allowed to do exactly that with all of my stuff, since it is covered by the GPL and totally open, but if you do then you absolutely **must** 1) read the rest of this section, 2) make your stuff open source, and 3) adopt the GPL (you do this implicitly once you absorb the code).

With that said, this mod and all of my source code is licensed under the GNU Public License (GPL).  As such, you are free to download, modify, distribute the source code and generated artifacts as long as your end-product also adopts the GPL.  To put it simply, if you use any intellectual product (source or idea) covered by the GPL then your source must become open-source, and you may not release "black box" artifacts (binaries) which contain the intellectual property covered by the GPL.

However, this does **not** apply if you treat the GPL-covered tool/library as a dependency.  Black box and "commercial off the shelf" (COTS) software can legally (and very frequently do) use open-source software covered by the GPL and other open-source licenses.

That's the short(ish) version.  Read the GPL (the LICENSE file in this repo) for full info.
